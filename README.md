## Why This Project?

I built this system to understand how machine learning can be applied to real financial data. The project combines several interests: understanding how markets work, applying statistical methods to real-world problems, and building something that could potentially help with investment decisions.

The choice to focus on major tech and financial companies reflects both data availability and the opportunity to analyze companies with different business models and market behaviors. This provides a more comprehensive view of how different sectors perform and how various economic factors impact stock prices.

## What I Learned

Working on this project taught me about the complexity of financial markets and the challenges of prediction. While the models show promising results, they also highlight the inherent uncertainty in market behavior and the importance of risk management in any investment strategy.
